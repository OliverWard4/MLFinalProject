# ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using Ensemble Methods

This project explores ensemble learning techniques for ECG-based arrhythmia classification. It is part of a final project submitted for a machine learning course, with a focus on combining multiple classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to improve precision in medical diagnosis tasks.

## Project Overview

The notebooks include:
- Data preprocessing and normalization using the ECG5000 dataset.
- Feature extraction from ECG signals.
- Model training using ensemble techniques including soft voting classifiers.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.
- Reimplementation of methods inspired by published ECG classification research.
